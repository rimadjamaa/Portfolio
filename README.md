## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from our collective passion for solving real-world problems through technology. We wanted to create something impactful that not only showcases our technical skills but also contributes positively to the community. Our journey began when we identified a common challenge many people face problem of bulding their own portfolio, and we decided to address it through this project.

Our timeline started with brainstorming and ideation sessions , followed by extensive research and planning. We officially kicked off the development phase and have been working diligently to bring this project to life. This project also serves as a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, where we've applied the knowledge and skills we've gained throughout our coursework.
